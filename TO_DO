GENERAL:

1. ATB added comments in various places in rot3d.c, pycresta.py, tom.py related to the various angle conventions and conversions. 
Please read and and suggest more explanations if needed. The code is extremely convoluted and the angle conventions are quite confusing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
DONE:

1. Plot Back: ATB fixed inverse Euler angle issue in Plot Back (briefly, reverse engineered what was done for masking,
call to eulerconvert_xmipp, swap angles indices 0 and 1).  ATB also incorporated small shifts from star file and
added an info message after each plot back subtomogram has been written. I added comments in cresta.py and tom.py.


2. Modify: ATB fixed issue: manual (x,y,z) rottrans produces sometimes bus error when operating on previously rotated volumes:

- the issue is this statement in def processParticler in tom.py
   outH1 = cut_out(outH1, np.array([0, 0, 0]), boxsize)   
   ATB commented it out - it is only used in that place. It makes the box smaller if there are values < 1? This does not make much sense!  
   it produces a box that is 255,255,255 rather than 256,256,256. This mismatch causes issues with subsequent rotate commands.
 - another issue is the interpolation exception treatment in rot3d.c. I reverted back to the original code, but included additional cushion:
 - finally, ATB calculates the mean of the image density and use that for the pixels outside the range, except for masks where the value is set to zero.
  - I added comments in rot3d.c.

3. Plot back mrc files sometimes were mapped to the same position in Chimera/ChimeraX (e.g,. 14, 15, 16, 22-38  in 201810XX_MPI/SV4_003_dff/sub), although the header indicates different positions.  ATB fixed this by changing from nxstart, nystart, nzstart to origin.x, origin.y, origin.z since that works more reliably in Chimera.

TODO:

1. Filtering: Each time pycresta creates a new directory with subtomograms, please write all information about settings and inputs as a text 
file into that directory, i.e., project text file. So, if the user performs filtering, the file should contain the information about
the particular settings and inputs that were used for the filtering job. -->> OK, but please also do for Gaussian.

2. Extraction: Incorporate calc angles directly into Extraction as an option. Ask user to specify the file extensions for the 
start and end point coordinates rather than full path names.  

3.Extraction: Introduce batch mode for Extraction with multiple tomograms in one directory.

4. Plot Back:
   - parallelize the process 
   - test if it works if the star file refers to multiple tomograms.

5. Extraction: write info about star file, and populate Master Key at end of Extraction/Calculate Angles

6. Masking: populate Master Key at end of Masking

7. Modify: write info about star file and populate Master key at end of Modify -> Rotate... and -> Rotate Manually.

9. Modify: Set zero angles in new star file after star file or manual rotations.

10. Extraction: assumes the coords file is an integer with a single space between coordinate points (i.e. "int1 int2 int3"). 
This isn't the default output of IMOD model2point - at least my version - which defaults to float and 
tab separated values ("    float1    float2    float3"). Comma separated values also fail for the same reason since the string cannot be converted to int. 
-> Auto-detect format: convert floats to an integer, and handle separators other than single spaces (any number of spaces or other delimiters).

11. Several: Please add a test to ensure that the box dimensions and pixel sizes match in Master Key match those of the 
subtomogram in the rotation tasks, masking, correlation calc. (e.g., prior to calling the rot3d.c function). pixel 
size mismatch should be warning only. Box dimension mismatch should stop program. Look for "ATB todo" in 
cresta.py and tom.py. But, there may be other places as well.

12. Related to this, when using Masking with the standard mask file, I get this error message:

Center, boxsize, filter, grow, normalizeit, sdrange, sdshift,blackdust,whitedust,shiftfil,randfilt,permutebg)

 IndexError: index 16515072 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 16515072


13. Masking, Modify, and Plot Back: test that shifts from Star file are properly applied.

14. Extraction: check what happens when extraction is done close border of tomogram? Qiang says:

For the straddling issue, I think it depends on the box size. For most cases, it is the box rather than the particle itself straddling the border, I would suggest just to fulfill with noise. However, one thing to keep in mind, because of the tilt angle of y-axis as well as the shifting of tilt images, for quite a large region of the border, the missing wedge issue is more terrible. It is better to exclude these particles from averaging. This kind of border is estimated in the WARP reconstructions, not in IMOD ones.

1. Try Chimerax plugin ArtiaX, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36251681/, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pro.4472  Any comments?

2. Add the box size and pixel size as a comment into the cmm files? For future.

3. Memory mapping for Filtering? Not possible.
